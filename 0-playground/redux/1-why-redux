Why redux?
    - for complex apps that dont have a single component that stores the state of the app
        - just like when we are using react-router, and we have multiple parents for the app

    - components aren't reusable
        - to reuse components we need to chain props trough components that dont need to use those props, only pass them on, which is not proffesional
        - the chainning is complex and hard to follow
